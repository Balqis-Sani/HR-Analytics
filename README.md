1. Regular workforce analysis should be conducted to ensure the company maintains an optimal employee-to-workload ratio and identifies any need for future hiring or restructuring.

2. The company should analyze why hiring peaked in 2021â€”whether due to expansion, seasonal demand, or replacements. If hiring has slowed down since, consider evaluating current workforce needs and long-term recruitment strategies.

3. To promote diversity and inclusion, the company should explore hiring initiatives that attract a more balanced workforce across different demographics. This could include targeted recruitment efforts, diversity training, and inclusive workplace policies.

4. Conduct exit interviews to understand why employees leave and implement retention strategies, such as career development programs, competitive salaries, and employee engagement initiatives. Compare the attrition rate with industry benchmarks to assess whether intervention is needed.

5. Highest Bonuses in Corporate & Specialty Products Business Units & Marketing Department:

6. Ensure that the bonus distribution aligns with company performance goals and employee contributions. Transparency in bonus allocation and performance-based incentives can boost motivation across departments.

7. If the Vice President's bonus is significantly higher than other executives, ensure the structure is fair and justified based on responsibilities and performance. Clear communication on executive compensation can help maintain employee trust.
